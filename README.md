# Berkeley-CS188-Projects
My solutions to Berkeley CS188 projects, Fall 2018


## Outline

- [P0: UNIX/Python Tutorial](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project0.html)
	This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces students to the Python programming language and the UNIX environment.

- [P1: Search](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project1.html)
	Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

- [P2: Multi-Agent Search](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project2.html)
	Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

- [P3: Reinforcement Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project3.html)
	Students implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

- [P4: Ghostbusters](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project4.html)
	Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Students implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.
